              You are not your experience. You are your talents and abilities. And honestly, so much more than that. Experience shapes, but it does not define you. For those who have recently lost their position, or who remained and lost teams, colleagues, and friends from the mass of layoffs… this event should inform you. It does not define 'you' or 'your value' in any way. You are valued, appreciated, and respected by your peers, your managers, your mentees, and friends & family. The component of business driving these events is not a reflection of the personal or individual evaluation of any one individual. Stay strong.
            </p>

            <p>Recently my employer, like many others coming out of 2022 and into 2023, decided a mass layoff. For the design team alone, 60% of the organization woke up to a completely different reality than that which they were in, less than a day prior. The hit was much different for me. I was the only one on my immediate team that was spared. I was not sure how to take that. The flood of emotions and thoughts was quite a rush. I was questioning and answering myself quicker than I could think clearly about what had just taken place. I have been on many sides of these sorts of situations. This, however, was the first situation where the team I was on was dispatched in full, sans myself. Those whom I work with are immensely talented.</p>

            <p>Cliché or not to say… but honestly, they will be fine. Each of them is pure talent. There will be bumps and bruises along the way. Hardships and challenges. When they land on that next team, they will do their best. I know this. The accomplishments we, as a team had made over the past year and were staging for the coming year, were leaps and bounds. Excitement and enthusiasm were high. The team was ready for the flag to drop and to jump out the gates. However, on that particular Wednesday morning (let me manual-correct that to 'mourning') it was the wrong flag that waved.</p>

            <p>Those who are now moving on to new chapters in life and career will do exactly that. Move along. The emotion will fade. The buzz from the shock will begin to vibrate a bit less each day. Each of the designers (and non-designers alike) will land their next role to carry them forward. Not without hardship, challenge, emotions, and personal adjustment. I in no way mean to diminish this for anyone. Nor to simply say "you'll be fine, you'll land a job with no problem". Because I know, it will be that way for some, but not all. I recognize that it's more complicated than that. Given that everyone's situation is unique and of their own.</p>

            <hr class="peraa-article-full__divider">

            <p>One thing that we all share is how we will define ourselves and who we are in these and all situations, which are the culmination of life experiences. <strong>Please do not take this event personally.</strong> It was not in any way about one single person. Your project, your work, and what you had ahead of you were obviously not a factor. In fact, I may argue that this was not about any of us. It is just business. Plain and simple. "Macroeconomics", "global market shift", "risk management", "resource planning" … answering to shareholders is all I hear. As cold, faceless, and as callous as that sounds, I also understand it. It is part of the model. It commits the sentiment that it was purely mechanical. Just bottom dollar. Any and/or all of those were driving factors. Completely void of empathy. This means it could not be about 'who' any of us are or what we are capable of. So, again, try to not take it personally. Everything that you 'bring to the table' is still intact. Your skill, knowledge, and ability do not change.</p>

            <p>As you begin to pull together the work, the resume, the 'this' and 'that', please understand that what you have done is only a portion of the story. I often tell the design students I work with and mentor that when they receive an 'offer' to join a team, it far more relates to a connection that is made. Yes, experience plays a role as well. I am not dismissing that component. What I am saying though is what we take, from experience to experience is a clear understanding of our current operating model. Albeit retrospectively, we take this understanding and reflection and it informs our process and thinking. Our style and approach. Lessons learned and ideas gained. But the experience stays put and remains past tense. The new one becomes present. From there, we respond accordingly, moving forward in a direction.</p>

            <hr class="peraa-article-full__divider">

            <p>Take this moment to reflect. To learn more about yourself. Focus on your intention for what will come next. Brush up the portfolio and profile. Read or listen to that book you have been meaning to get to. See or talk to some friends and family. Take a walk. Most importantly… <strong>breathe</strong>. Take in and let go. I see so many people sending gracious and appreciative comments and notes on the joys of having worked alongside each other. Extending their networks to others in search of work. Posting with positivity that despite the uncomfortable news received, they reflect the appreciation and thankfulness towards the peers and colleagues they worked with.</p>

            <p class="peraa-article-full__conclusion">
              In it all, I come to offer the sentiment that this moment of the challenge will pass. You have admiring support from many. Those who remain by your side. And those who will be welcoming you to their team. We are cheering you on.
