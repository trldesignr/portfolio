              In the world of digital mobile app products, having a clear product owner is of utmost importance in ensuring the success of a product. The product owner is responsible for making key decisions throughout the design and development process, ensuring that the end product meets the needs of its users and achieves its business objectives. In this blog, I touch on some personal experiences of how things worked and/or fell apart for some of the product teams that face the reality of losing clear product ownership. Overall, I will discuss the importance of having a product owner and the benefits that come with it.
            </p>

            <hr class="peraa-article-full__divider">

            <h2>Scenario 1</h2>

            <p>I came on to a team that was primarily tech/dev and business owned, respective to how the end-user experience was being shaped. Historically, the business team gathered user requirements, and acceptance criteria, and handed them off to the devs who would go build the UI and flows. In those early days of the project, the UX and UI designers were only supporting the documentation of the decision.</p>

            <p>The product owner was an extremely well-respected leader in the organization that had subject matter expertise and understood what we needed to build. She was clear and reflective of the voice of the business and the end-user. And most importantly, trusted her team. There were no concerns, or uncertainty about the product experience vision or how we were delivering week to week. She held the sword and fell on it when needed. We had a leader and the product had its owner.</p>

            <p><strong>And then… our product owner announced her retirement.</strong></p>

            <p>For the following 3 years from that announcement, the entire project inside and out went from a tightly run ship turned floating shipwreck sailing straight into a category 5 hurricane. Props to those that came in during those years and kept it afloat. We eventually gained a strong product owner once again. The "ship" made it through the storm and ultimately back to smooth waters. It was successful in the end.</p>

            <hr class="peraa-article-full__divider">

            <h2>Scenario 2</h2>

            <p>In another experience, I came onto a product that had no product owner defined from the get-go. There was only a vision and a democratized one at that. High enough level to be agreed upon by leadership. Which gave the support to spin up teams, and allocate budgets and headcounts. However, lacked the clarity of defining the edges that could ultimately shape what exactly it is we were going to design and build.</p>

            <p>Concepts were presented in high fidelity and of course… were concepts. Sacrificial at most. Meant to facilitate some sort of discussion on what the product was even going to do, provide to the user, look like… anything. The feedback, can you change this and that to be that and this? Only for the next review to be more changes, suggestions, and asks. Never <em>"Yes, this is the product experience we want for our clients and customers. Let's focus on these features, refine them for a p1 and p2, and define our launch."</em></p>

            <p>Frustration amongst design, engineers waiting in tow, managers managing the confusion, and spreadsheets to track everything of nothing. The result… I'm still checking the app store to see. Perhaps I'll update in a follow-up/vol. 2.</p>

            <hr class="peraa-article-full__divider">

            <p>No matter the experience I have had, it has always been abundantly clear. No clear product owner, or at the very least someone not taking initiative to own the space… things still progress, just not [a] product. It's just a 'ghost in the shell'. Introducing a product owner or seeing someone acting the part and taking the lead, whether in passing or outright, then products rise from the wild concepts and executive sponsored all hands demos, with praise and without a question. Just a sense of <em>"Wow, the team came together and made this happen"</em>. I assure you, there was someone in there that humbly steadied the wheel.</p>

            <p>Foremost, having a product owner brings clarity to the decision-making process. Without a clear owner, decisions can become muddled and delayed, leading to a lack of direction and focus. A product owner serves as the point person for decision-making, setting priorities, and ensuring that the product is aligned with the overall goals of the business. They work closely with the development team, providing clear guidance on features and functionality, and making sure that everyone is on the same page.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, a product owner provides a single point of accountability for the product. They are responsible for the success of the product and are the primary point of contact for stakeholders and customers alike. This accountability ensures that the product owner is fully invested in the success of the product and is motivated to make decisions that will lead to its success. In contrast, without a clear owner, responsibility can become diffuse, and no one feels fully invested in the product's success.</p>

            <p>Another benefit of having a product owner is that they provide a critical voice in the design and development process. As the primary stakeholder for the product, they bring a deep understanding of user needs and business objectives. They can advocate for features and functionality that will be most valuable to users, and ensure that the product is designed with the end user in mind. This user-centric approach is critical to the success of any digital mobile app product.</p>

            <p>Finally, having a product owner can help to prevent scope creep and keep the development process on track. The product owner is responsible for setting priorities and ensuring that the team stays focused on the most important features and functionality. They can help to prevent the development process from getting bogged down in unnecessary features or changes that do not align with the overall goals of the product.</p>

            <h2>May someone step in and fill the gap?</h2>

            <p>In my experience, absolutely. Even if there is not a clearly defined role within the team or organization for the given or would-be product, it's the spirit behind that individual that may come out of someone, anyone that may be just enough. There may be things that fall between the cracks. It may be slower and less effective. However, it is still far more beneficial than everyone waiting for someone to call out the north star. I have seen business team members, engineers, designers, and even managers provide the right voice in the right meeting and at the correct time to make a difference. It also doesn't need to be 'just one person' (though it really should). It was likely to maintain consistency, but even multiple people that are speaking with the same "voice", have prevailed.</p>

            <p class="peraa-article-full__conclusion">
              In conclusion, having a clear product owner is essential to the success of any digital mobile app product. They bring clarity, accountability, critical insight, and focus to the design and development process, ensuring that the product meets the needs of its users and achieves its business objectives. Without a clear owner, decisions can become muddled, responsibility diffuses, and the product may struggle to meet its goals. Therefore, businesses should prioritize identifying a product owner who can guide the product to success.
